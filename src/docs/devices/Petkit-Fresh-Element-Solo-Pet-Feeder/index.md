## Product description

This is an automatic pet feeder for cat/dog sized pets with a proprietary cloud based app. The mainboard has an
ESP32-WROOM-32D chip on it and thus can be flashed with an ESPHome firmware to be controlled locally.

The feeder comes with a US power adapter and a barrel connector if ordered from
[Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFV4B369), but can be powered by any 5V power adapter with a barrel connector.

Official product [page](https://petkit.com/products/fresh-element-solo).

## Dissasembly

The feeder base has to be taken apart to access the mainboard. This requires removal of four screws at the bottom side,
hidden under the rubber feet. The rubber feet have to be partially peeled off to access the screws. Once the screws are
removed, gently remove the base. Quite a lot of force may be required, as the red glue (pictured in the section below)
used to secure the connectors in place may be adhered to the base. A heat gun on low or a hair dryer might help to
loosen up the adhesive.

## Flashing

There are two (known) revisions of the mainboard:

### Revision A

See the the wiring diagram for flashing below (borrowed from the Reddit
[comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Esphome/comments/v19c7p/comment/jvl91mi/)). Press and hold the right button (the wifi
button) while plugging the adapter in, and release after a second or two to enter boot mode.

### Revision B

This board revision is covered in silicone on the front, but there are testing pads on the bottom that can be soldered
to for flashing.

![Revision B Wiring Diagram](./Petkit-Fresh-Element-Solo-Pet-Feeder-Flashing-B.png)

As with Revision A, hold the wifi button while plugging in the serial adapter and release after a couple seconds to
enter boot mode.

Revision B appears to otherwise have the same pinout as Revision A.

### Internal pinout

| Pin    | Function                 |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| GPIO5  | Status LED               |
| GPIO16 | RTTTL Buzzer             |
| GPIO34 | Feed button              |
| GPIO27 | Feeder motor sensor      |
| GPIO14 | Food optical sensor      |
| GPIO19 | Feeder motor control\*   |
| GPIO33 | Feeder sensors control\* |
| GPIO18 | Feed forward control\*   |
| GPIO17 | Reverse feed control\*   |

\* _purpose of some of these pins is unclear_

## Config

The base hardware config below covers the LED, buzzer, UART link to the feeder's motor controller, and the
motor/button/sensor GPIOs. It boots into ESPHome's default fallback hotspot and has no scheduling logic of its own —
use it to confirm the board is flashed and wired correctly before layering one of the full configs below on top.

```yaml file=config.yaml
```

Pick one of the two full configs below to actually run the feeder — both build on the hardware above and add WiFi,
the API, OTA, and a feeding schedule; they differ only in how that schedule is configured.

### Number input schedule

This config is intended to make the feeder tolerant to Home Assistant failures, by supporting HA-offline scheduling
capability (but it still requires WiFi and Internet connection to synchronize time with SNTP servers, or the schedule
won't work).

It exposes multiple entities that can be used to configure the feeding schedule for every hour of the day.\
User can set a number of scoops to be dispensed at particular hour of a day (if set to 0 - no food will be dispensed).

Food can be also dispensed manually either via hardware button on the right side of the feeder, or via the switch
entity.\
The portion size of the manual dispense is configured separately using a slider.

Low food level threshold value allows the feeder to dispatch an `esphome.feeder_food_low` event with the message
containing the firendly feeder name (handy if multiple feeders are in use), when a food sensor counts per scoop gets
below the threshold.\
Feeder will also play a siren sound hourly between 7am and 10pm (7 and 22) inclusively, unless sounds are muted via
dedicated switch.\
An automation can be configured to listen to the event and notify users about low food level (example is at the end).

```yaml file=petkit_fresh_element_solo_number_input.yaml
```

### Mealplan compatible schedule

Alternatively to the number input schedule above, this config exposes the feeding schedule as a b64 encoded string
that is compatible with the [MealPlan card](https://github.com/FredrikM97/mealplan-card).

This string is compatible with Tuya devices and decodes bytes as follows:

`[day, hour, minute, portion, enabled]`
Days are a bitmask with sunday as the first day:
`[saturday, sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday]`
e.g. 127 = b01111111 = All days

```yaml file=petkit_fresh_element_solo_b64_mealplan.yaml
```

Homeassistant will now expose the text component as a sensor that can be used in the mealplan-card. Any of the
generic Tuya devices may be selected when configuring the card:

- Cleverio PF100
- Fukumaru-W (f1y6wo)
- Yuposl (enyxp8)
- Arlec PF002HA
- PetLibro (000004ajdj)
- MolyPet F02W
- Petrust
- Meowmatic
- Wuipet (du4l-wc-01)
- Pixi
- Rojeco (2L Pet Feeder)
- Kalado KPF01

## Automation example

```yaml
alias: Pet feeder notifications
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: esphome.feeder_food_low
    id: food_low
  - platform: event
    event_type: esphome.feeder_food_dispensed
    id: food_dispensed
condition: []
action:
  - if:
      - condition: trigger
        id:
          - food_low
    then:
      - service: notify.notify
        metadata: {}
        data:
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.message }}"
      - service: notify.persistent_notification
        metadata: {}
        data:
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.message }}"
mode: single
```

_Note: currently, `esphome.feeder_food_dispensed event` is ignored to not spam the users with multiple notifications
about food being dispensed multiple times a day. Only `esphome.feeder_food_low` will result in persistent notification
in Home Assistant and mobile app notifications._
